# 📈 Stock Trading Algorithms

Welcome to the **Stock Trading Algorithms** repository! This project implements and compares various stock trading algorithms and machine learning neural network trained simulations.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains different stock trading algorithms and machine learning models to simulate and compare their performance. The goal is to provide insights into how these algorithms perform under different market conditions.

## 📌 Features

- **Algorithm Implementations**: A variety of trading algorithms including moving averages, RSI, MACD, and more.
- **ML Models**: Neural network models trained to predict stock price movements.
- **Performance Comparison**: Tools to compare the performance of different algorithms and models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-trading-algorithms.git
    cd stock-trading-algorithms
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## 📈 How to Use

Execute the main file with a chosen stock ticker and a time range to see the algorithm's performance in this interval.

### Example

```bash
python main.py AAPL 2023-01-01 2023-12-31
```
